## Brag Sheet
- I founded the [Astronomy Club at EBPL](https://ilove.ebpl.org/teens/events/astronomy-club-zoom/2020-12-19-160000-2020-12-19-170000) last year with my friends. We were taking the Astronomy elective and wanted to make an Astronomy Club together in EBHS. However, our application was rejected by the school because of the overabundance of clubs. So, we applied to the EB Public Library and started hosting presentations/meetings on Zoom every month. In the future, we also want to do some in-person events over the summer such as making bottle rockets or using telescopes. 
- I got a 1550 on the SAT. I have only taken the SAT once, in December 2020, because the pandemic delayed and canceled some of my exam registrations. I am planning to take it again this Friday (6/5/2021) and maybe get a better score!
- For sports, I enjoy golf, swimming, roller skating, and dance. Swim: I used to be on a competitive swimming team, the Sandpipers, but I was never exceptional at swimming, so I eventually quit and just decided to do it for fun. Dance: I am in an organization called IAGS (Indian Association of Garden State), which is where I learn bollywood dances and choreography to perform in cultural events. Golf: I have been learning golf since 7th or 8th grade and am on my school team. Roller skating: I initially learned how to roller skate in Mumbai, India when I was in 1st grade. I recently started relearing and taking classes at the Woodbridge Community Center.
